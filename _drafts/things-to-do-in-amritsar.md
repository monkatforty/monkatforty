  Amritsar is a city I want to speak of today, on the 75th Independence Day as we celebrate
  ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav’. The city exudes ‘Indianness’ in every possible way; historically,
  geographically, socially, culturally and spiritually. As I go ahead with the list of things to do in
  Amritsar, slowly the reason will unfold as to why I chose to write about Amritsar today.
  Visit the Historical Site of Jallianwala Bagh 
  Close to the Golden Temple Complex stands the Jallianwala Bagh which is a ‘memorial of
  national importance. At this garden the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre   occurred on the festival
  of Baisakhi, on 13th April, 1919. The memory of thousand unarmed Indians- men, women
  and children, brutally killed and wounded by 1650 rounds of firing under the command of
  General Dyer still haunts one. The bullet marks are preserved and the well in which
  frightened people plunged in is still there. Visiting Jallianwala Bagh and the museum and
  gallery to honour our history, in remembrance to all those who gave their lives for the
  Indian freedom movement is one of the major things to do in Amritsar. There are several
  memorial structures, the ‘Martyr’s Memorial’ being the most significant one and more have
  been added with the recent renovation. The tricolour flying high here brings tears to the
  eyes, reminding us of the great martyrs. Ashes of Sardar Udham Singh is preserved here and
  the entrance has his statue too. Rabindranath Tagore renounced his knighthood in
  condemnation of the Jallianwala tragedy.
  Visit India’s Most Popular Border, the Wagah-Attari Border
  Visiting the Wagah-Attari Border for the ceremonious military display by India’s Border
  Security Force (BSF) and Pakistan Rangers is a must in your list of things to do in Amritsar.
  The military drills, described as ‘colourful’, is a symbol of both country’s display of
  brotherhood and cooperation amidst rivalry and tensions. There is a slot for the common
  audience to jump and rejoice and dance to the beats of patriotic songs. This ceremony is
  active since 1959. I found the energy and vibe of the audience amazing. Huge number of
  people from both the nations visit to witness this remarkable ceremony. Some civilians at
  that time even cross the borders with due papers and prior permission. It is a part of the
  ceremony. The high marches of the military personnel with legs raised as high as possible,
  women members of the force and the military dogs amazed me. The iron gates of both the
  nations open during sunset as the flags are folded marking the end of the ceremony and
  then the gates close with a handshake between soldiers from either side.
  Visit the Golden Temple
  Golden Temple is the first thing that comes to mind when we speak of Amritsar. Visiting the
  Golden Temple is the most important of all the things to do in Amritsar. It is a Gurdwara
  called ‘Harmandir Sahib or Durbar Sahib’, the most prominent spiritual site of the Sikhs. This
  temple is at the heart of the city and it is beyond narrow shackles of religion. One must visit
  this to see the alluring beauty of the temple; the dazzling gold tomb, the holy pool and the
  sparkling white marble. There’s no speck of dust and this temple is an epitome of
  community service where people are serving other people. It houses one of world’s largest

  kitchens, the langar. Free vegetarian meals are cooked in this community kitchen and served
  to thousands of visitors and devotees daily without any discrimination. Neither your faith
  nor your bank balance play a role here. One must have the prasad from the langar; it is
  blissful and tasty. Kara Prasad (ghee laden halwa) should not be missed too. One must visit
  the temple complex at least twice, once in the morning and once in the evening. In the
  evening I found the Golden Temple breath-taking. Visiting the temple soothes the mind,
  body and soul.
  Eat Amritsari Delicacies
  When you eat at Amritsar, you must go absolutely desi with your taste buds. Amritsari
  kulcha with chholey and a generous dollop of butter, Amritsari machhi, tikkas, kebabs and
  tandooris, lassi and kulfi are the ones you just can’t leave out. Even milk tea at Amritsar is
  special and don’t miss ‘aam papad’. Eating out is among the most significant things to do in
  Amritsar as this city is a pilgrimage for foodies. The taste buds will enjoy the plethora of
  Indian spices.
  Don’t Miss Shopping at Amritsar
  Don’t think twice about shopping at Amritsar. Markets in Amritsar is every girl’s favourite
  when it comes to ethnics like phulkaris, juttis, gorgeous jewellery and clutches and bags.
  Phulkari is Punjab’s traditional embroidery and carries the GI (Geographical Indications) tag.
  One can explore from budget friendly items to extremely lush and expensive items here. So
  exploring the markets in Amritsar is one of the major things to do in Amritsar.
  Explore Folk Arts at Amritsar
  Folk dances like Giddha and Bhangra are world famous because of their rhythm, energy and
  vivid dressing up. These dances are not only entertaining but represent scenes from daily
  life of a local. Then there is Gatka, a form of martial art presented very rhythmically. These
  folk dances and music are so indigenous, representing India at the very core.
  Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav and Amritsar
  So now you definitely know why I chose to speak of Amritsar today on ‘Azadi Ka Amrit
  Mahotsav’. Everything about the city; its history, geography, art and culture; is
  extraordinarily original; extraordinarily Indian.
