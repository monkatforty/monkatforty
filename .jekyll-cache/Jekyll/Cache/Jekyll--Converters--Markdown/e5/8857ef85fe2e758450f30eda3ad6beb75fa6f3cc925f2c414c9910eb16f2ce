I"x<p>In 1947, Japanese Buddhist Monk, Nichidatsu Fuji, the founder of Nipponzan Myohoji, a Neo-Buddhist Organisation devised the plan of constructing Peace Pagodas all over the world. He was highly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi. The pagodas were means of promoting peace and also a way of honouring and remembering those who died and suffered in the atomic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Today there are 7 World Peace Pagodas in India out of the total 80 Peace Pagodas spread across the globe. Today, on Hiroshima Day, letâ€™s have a quick look at the Peace Pagodas in India.They are also called Vishwa Shanti Stupas in India.</p>
