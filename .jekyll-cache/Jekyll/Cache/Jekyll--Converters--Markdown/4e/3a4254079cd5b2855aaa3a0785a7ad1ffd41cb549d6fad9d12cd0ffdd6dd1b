I"Ü<p>This Holi I made a trip to Sittong, an Offbeat Destination near Darjeeling, with my Mom. Just a long weekend (3 days) was enough. Yet during such a short trip we enjoyed almost all the things to see in Sittong, soaking into the unadulterated natureâ€™s bliss. Havenâ€™t you heard of Sittong? It is a cluster of small villages called Sittong Khasmahal, at 4000 to 4500 feet, located in Kurseong Subdivision of Darjeeling District. Sittong is known for its oranges, tea, cinchona and natural brooms called â€˜phuljharuâ€™ in Bengali, besides pristine natural beauty of the Eastern Himalayas.</p>
